So Inotia00 discontinoud Youtube RVX because of people who download rvx from fake websites and people who send their problems via PM repeatedly without reading the Docs so i thought ima list some alternatives to it. I've already created a [Post for youtube clients ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterVanced/comments/15eezgu/_/)now I want to do the same for yt music clients

  

## Android
  

If you want to use something like modded yt music (no custom front end) then you could use [normal ReVanced ](https://revanced.app/)or the [latest RVX Build](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-manager)(v6.12.53).
